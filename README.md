# 100daysofcode_python
This repo is to document my journey through the 100daysofcode challenge learning advanced and more difficult concepts of python. I wonder what kind of programmer would I end up being if I kept doing these challenges and finished them. Most importantly tho, what kind of python programmer would I come out to be after the successful completion of this challenge.
